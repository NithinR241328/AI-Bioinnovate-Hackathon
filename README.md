Protein Engineering - PE4
PE4 - Identify features that significantly contribute to classification accuracy by applying various
feature selection methods and eventually building a stacked ensemble method
1. The given dataset is a feature vector of blood brain barrier penetrating peptides. Class ‘1’
are blood brain barrier penetrating peptides; 0 are non-b3p2
2. It has different types of features. The final dataset has feature size greater than sample
size. Provided training dataset (b3p2_training) and independent dataset
(b3p2_fusion_independent)
